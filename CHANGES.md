# Changes

## Version 1.1 (2013-02-02)

* Speed improvements. The ``FeatureTrie`` class was rewritten such that feature access is now even faster than before.
* Self-contained release. The previous release used a library called ``dlib``, which was developed in parallel. This code has been integrated into ``beta``.

## Version 1.0 (2013-01-26)

* Initial release.
